            <h1><i class="fa fa-question-circle"></i> General bio</h1>
            <p>Hey, I'm jordiisepic. I'm interested in web development, the Wii U, and the project known as <a target="_blank" href="https://wiilink24.com">WiiLink24</a>! Some of the music I listen to consists of artists like: Dismemberment Plan, Nirvana, Green Day, and Kanye West. I don't really know any coding languages, the only important things I know are basic HTML & CSS. I don't know what else to write here.</p>

            <h1><i class="fas fa-alien-monster"></i> Main interests</h1>
            <p>I've been interested in the Wii U, and <a target="_blank" href="https://wiilink24.com">WiiLink24</a>, as I've said but I also like collecting physical media like audio CD's, video DVD's, audio vinyls, and more! At a young age I was exposed to game systems and technology in general and I've been fascinated by these topics in general ever since. My main passtimes are listening to music, and tinkering with my iPod. In the future I would like to either be an interior designer, technician, or work with tech support.</p>
